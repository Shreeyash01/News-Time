# News Time

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Developed a simple Front end website in React for News. Used News-Api to fetch latest News related to different news categories and displayed them separately under each news category page. Used react-routing for smooth routing through different news category pages.
